All solutions in this repository are created with test driven approach in mind. There's no user interface, and the only way to execute the code is to run the tests (note that some tests could be still failing for the most complex challenges).

You need a Node server and npm for package management. To setup the project open your terminal and type
```
npm install
```

To run the tests:
```
npm test
```
